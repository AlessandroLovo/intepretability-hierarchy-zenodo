# Code for the paper "Interpretability of prediction in a hierarchy of Machine Learning models for extreme heatwaves"

## Setup

To be able to run the notebooks in this repository, you need to clone the [Climate-Learning](https://github.com/georgemilosh/Climate-Learning) repository.

To do put yoursel in the same directory of this file and run

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/georgemilosh/Climate-Learning.git
```

Reproducing the figures will use only the submodule [general_purpose](https://github.com/AlessandroLovo/general_purpose), but training the neural networks and visualizing them needs the full Climate-Learning framework.
